# Performance Optimizations for Music Visualizer

This document outlines the comprehensive performance optimizations implemented to reduce phone heating and improve battery life while maintaining visual quality.

## Overview

The music visualizer has been optimized to significantly reduce CPU usage, GPU load, and memory consumption while preserving the core visual experience. These optimizations are adaptive and will automatically adjust based on device performance.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Adaptive Frame Rate Control
- **Target FPS**: Reduced from 60fps to 30fps (50% reduction in rendering load)
- **Adaptive Adjustment**: Automatically reduces to 20fps on low-performance devices
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time FPS tracking with automatic throttling
- **Thermal Management**: Additional throttling when device temperature is high

### 2. Audio Processing Optimizations
- **FFT Size Reduction**: Reduced from 1024 to 512 samples (50% reduction in processing)
- **Processing Intervals**: Audio analysis throttled to every 50ms instead of continuous
- **Band Energy Calculation**: Optimized with sample skipping for better performance
- **History Management**: Reduced energy history from 12 to 8 samples

### 3. Rendering Optimizations
- **Bubble Count Reduction**: Reduced from 10 to 8 maximum bubbles, 6 to 5 active bubbles
- **Shader Simplification**: Reduced iterations in watercolor noise from 4 to 3
- **Specular Calculation**: Limited to 4 bubbles instead of all bubbles
- **Color Caching**: Implemented HSV-to-RGB conversion caching
- **Background Simplification**: Reduced animation complexity

### 4. Memory Management
- **Object Pooling**: Pre-allocated arrays for bubble data
- **Reduced Allocations**: Minimized object creation during rendering
- **Buffer Reuse**: Efficient OpenGL buffer management
- **Cache Management**: Limited color cache size to prevent memory leaks

### 5. Device-Specific Optimization
- **Performance Detection**: Automatic device capability assessment
- **Adaptive Settings**: Different configurations for low/medium/high performance devices
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Real-time performance mode switching

2. **Compute Shaders**: Use compute shaders for audio processing
3. **Multi-threading**: Parallel audio and rendering processing
4. **LOD System**: Level-of-detail system for distant bubbles
5. **GPU Instancing**: Batch rendering for multiple bubbles

### Adaptive Quality
- Dynamic quality adjustment based on battery level
- User preference settings for quality vs. performance
- Automatic quality reduction during thermal throttling

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
1. Use `PerformanceConfig` for all performance-related settings
